Adaptive Math Question Engine (Python)

Project Description

This project is a Python-based math question engine.
It generates math questions based on the user’s skill level.

The difficulty changes automatically.
Correct answers increase the level.
Wrong answers decrease the level.

The goal is to help users practice math without getting bored or overwhelmed.



How It Works

1. The user selects a starting difficulty
2. A math question is generated
3. The user enters an answer
4. The program checks the answer
5. The difficulty level is updated
6. The process continues for multiple questions

The program runs in the terminal.



Difficulty System

The program includes multiple difficulty levels:

- Easy
- Medium
- Hard

Each level uses different number ranges and complexity.
The difficulty is dynamic, not fixed.



Features

- Random math question generation
- User input and answer checking
- Adaptive difficulty system
- Correct / incorrect feedback
- Clean and readable code structure



Programming Concepts Used

- Functions (def)
- Conditional statements (if / else)
- Loops (while)
- Random number generation
- User input (input)
- Error handling (try / except)

This project focuses on logic and problem-solving.



Future Improvements

- Exponents
- Square roots
- Fractions
- Graphical user interface (GUI)
- Saving user progress to a file



Use of AI Tools

AI tools were used only as learning assistance.
All code was understood, modified, and debugged manually.
